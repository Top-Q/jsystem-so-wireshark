  SystemObject for using TShark network protocol analyzer.<br>
  
  <b>Using TShark</b><br>
  TShark is a network protocol analyzer. It lets you capture packet data 
  from a live network, or read packets from a previously saved capture file,
  either printing a decoded form of those packets to the standard output
  or writing the packets to a file. TShark's native capture file format 
  is libpcap format, which is also the format used by tcpdump and various other tools.
  
  Without any options set, TShark will work much like tcpdump. It will use the
  pcap library to capture traffic from the first available network interface
  and displays a summary line on stdout for each received packet.
  
  TShark is able to detect, read and write the same capture files that are
  supported by Wireshark. The input file doesn't need a specific filename
  extension; the file format and an optional gzip compression will be
  automatically detected. Near the beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of
  wireshark(1) or <http://www.wire- shark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html> is
  a detailed description of the way Wireshark handles this, which is the same
  way Tshark handles this.
  
  Compressed file support uses (and therefore requires) the zlib library. If
  the zlib library is not present, TShark will compile, but will be unable to
  read compressed files.
  
  If the -w option is not specified, TShark writes to the standard output the
  text of a decoded form of the packets it captures or reads. If the -w option
  is specified, TShark writes to the file specified by that option the raw data
  of the packets, along with the packets' time stamps.
  
  When writing a decoded form of packets, TShark writes, by default, a summary
  line containing the fields specified by the preferences file (which are also
  the fields displayed in the packet list pane in Wire- shark), although if
  it's writing packets as it captures them, rather than writting packets from a
  saved capture file, it won't show the "frame number" field. If the -V option
  is specified, it writes instead a view of the details of the packet, showing
  all the fields of all pro- tocols in the packet.
  
  If you want to write the decoded form of packets to a file, run TShark
  without the -w option, and redirect its standard output to the file (do not
  use the -w option).
  
  When writing packets to a file, TShark, by default, writes the file in
  libpcap format, and writes all of the packets it sees to the output file. The
  -F option can be used to specify the format in which to write the file. This
  list of available file formats is displayed by the -h flag.
  
  Read filters in TShark, which allow you to select which packets are to be
  decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are filterable
  in TShark than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax you can use to
  create your filters is richer. As TShark progresses, expect more and more
  protocol fields to be allowed in read filters.
  
  Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library. The capture fil- ter
  syntax follows the rules of the pcap library. This syntax is dif- ferent from
  the read filter syntax. A read filter can also be specified when capturing,
  and only packets that pass the read filter will be displayed or saved to the
  output file; note, however, that capture fil- ters are much more efficient
  than read filters, and it may be more dif- ficult for TShark to keep up with
  a busy network if a read filter is specified for a live capture.
  
  A capture or read filter can either be specified with the -f or -R option,
  respectively, in which case the entire filter expression must be specified as
  a single argument (which means that if it contains spaces, it must be
  quoted), or can be specified with command-line arguments after the option
  arguments, in which case all the arguments after the filter arguments are
  treated as a filter expression. Capture filters are supported only when
  doing a live capture; read filters are supported when doing a live capture
  and when reading a capture file, but require TShark to do more work when
  filtering, so you might be more likely to lose packets under heavy load if
  you're using a read filter. If the filter is specified with command-line
  arguments after the option arguments, it's a capture filter if a capture is
  being done (i.e., if no -r option was specified) and a read filter if a
  capture file is being read (i.e., if a -r option was specified).<br>
